# SLackathon-OTT Paltform Analysis - Team Omega
#Whatâ€™s The problem ?
Since Pandemic ,the way users invest their time on OTT platforms has undergone massive changes.We have multiple OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Hulu etc.,available to stream not just ongoing but more than 50 year olds with more than a million of TV shows and movies online in every language. As a user, the entire process of going through the selection of movie or finding a movie toggling through every other platform is tedious. Most OTT platforms runs with subscription plan which requires consumers loyalty. The question is all these effort put in by a consumer for an hour or two entertainment worth it ? So, the objective of this Project is to make a user friendly integrated OTT model that wouldhelp users to choose between the OTT platforms and the videos they want to watch accordingto the mood.
