# #Whatâ€™s The problem ? 
Since Pandemic ,the way users invest their time on OTT platforms has undergone massive changes.We have multiple OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Hulu etc.,available to stream not just ongoing but more than 50 year olds with more than a million of TV shows and movies online in every language. SUbscribers are confused to opt which platform to avail they confused. So, the objective of this Project is to make a user friendly integrated OTT model that wouldhelp users to choose between the OTT platforms and the videos they want to watch accordingto the mood

# The Idea

To resolve the above stated problem we have come with the Idea of Rent-o-Flix : an OTT platform which is an integration of all major OTT platforms like
Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Hulu etc. so, the user should not toggle between apps, so users to avoid the confusion which to subscribe and pay
Secondly , we run algorithm, videos and series will be highlighted each platform according to the user choice. Moreover user can avail services on 
prepaid basis like hourly, daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly as per user choice similar like mobile prepaid

## #How can technology help?
For the first part of this project if we get approval from mentioned OTT, we want to use Boomi
Atmosphere platform which allows us to integrate multiple platforms. This platform connects
applications, data, and devices across your hybrid multi-cloud landscape with speed and ease.
Boomi provides an Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) which enables companies to achieve
their digital transformation goals faster by unifying application and data integration, API
management, workflow automation, B2B/EDI partners, data catalog and preparation, and master
data management in a single, scalable, cloud-based solution. Also, it supports Real Time
Integration.
