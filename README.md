# #Whatâ€™s The problem ? 
Since Pandemic ,the way users invest their time on OTT platforms has undergone massive changes.We have multiple OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Hulu etc.,available to stream not just ongoing but more than 50 year olds with more than a million of TV shows and movies online in every language. SUbscribers are confused to opt which platform to avail they confused. So, the objective of this Project is to make a user friendly integrated OTT model that wouldhelp users to choose between the OTT platforms and the videos they want to watch accordingto the mood

# The Idea

To resolve the above stated problem we have come with the Idea of Rent-o-Flix : an OTT platform which is an integration of all major OTT platforms like
Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Hulu etc. so, the user should not toggle between apps, so users to avoid the confusion which to subscribe and pay
Secondly , we run algorithm, videos and series will be highlighted each platform according to the user choice. Moreover user can avail services on 
prepaid basis like hourly, daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly as per user choice similar like mobile prepaid
